      <h2>A Guide to Digital Sound for Moving Brick Movies</h2>
      <h3><small>Article by david reino</small></h3>
      <p><em>This article focuses on how to record, mix, or otherwise create sound and sound tracks for animated movies, particularly those made with plastic building toys, and specifically those that are edited on a computer.</em></p>

      <h3 class="bbu">An Introduction</h3>
      <p>It seems that so much of today’s modern world of cinema is concerned solely with the ‘big names’ on screen&nbsp; - the actors, directors, and visual effects gurus of Hollywood, who get paid big bucks to make what’s on-screen believable and entertaining. Ask the average individual which sense they feel is the most important and 9 times out of 10 you will get “sight” as an answer. (After all, we “see” movies and “watch” TV, right?)</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the real answer is not that simple. If you’re like the average movie-goer, chances are that when you go to the theatre, you sit on the edge of your seat, transfixed by the screen, and munch on your popcorn, all the while without once giving thought to what you are hearing.</p>
      <p>And if you were the sound designer for this said film, you would have done your job correctly.</p>
      <p>Good sound is so subtle that we don’t even have to think about it – it’s just there, fluid, natural, precise, and crafted with equal skill as the computer-generated wonders or special effects that are projected onto the screen. Good sound effects are so effective (pun intended) that they never draw attention to themselves in an undue or obnoxious fashion (unless, of course, this is the sound designer’s intent!). Bad sound effects distract from the film itself and destroy the credibility of the imaginary world the filmmaker is attempting to involve us in. </p><p>The aim of this guide is not to teach you everything there is to know about making sound for movies. That in itself would be an enormous and unrealistic task – and what animator has that kind of time anyway? ;) Instead, I will focus on how to record, mix, or otherwise create sound and sound tracks for animated movies, particularly those made with plastic building toys, and specifically those that are edited on a computer. The idea here is to allow you to set yourself and your work a prime cut above the myriad of amateur work on YouTube or the like that falls victim to bad sound design or editing.</p>

      <h3>Digital Sound 101</h3>
      <p>This guide assumes that you are editing your films on a computer of some sort. Because of this, you will be dealing with digital rather than analog audio. Digital audio means a format that can be read by a computer, or in a primitive sense, represented by electronic 1’s and 0’s inside the machine. Analog audio media is becoming increasingly rare nowadays; it is usually the type that shows up at garage sales (records, cassette and VHS tapes.) These do not require a computer for playback, but are at a disadvantage due to the size of the media itself and the hardware that is required for playback. For the time being, think of digital and analog audio as two different languages that are capable of communicating the same basic idea, which is the sound itself.</p>
      <p>Analog SOUND, on the other hand – an entity distinct from analog media -&nbsp; is in ready abundance in today’s modern world. It is, in fact, the only means by which we as humans can appreciate music, movies, or the sonic world around us. Before you hear anything, a sound source travels through the air in all directions at 340 m/s until it reaches your ears and is interpreted by your brain. This analog sound source could be the sound itself, or man-made means such as speakers or headphones. It should be noted that virtually all analog sound needs to be captured by analog equipment before being converted to a digital format, and vice versa. There is no such thing as a microphone that captures sound digitally, or a set of speakers that reproduce sound digitally.</p>

      <h3>Sampling Rate, Bitrate, and Frequency</h3>
      <p>In reference to digital audio, you are liable to hear these three terms quite often, but it is important to understand exactly what they mean. Analog audio is often symbolized by the image above, referred to as a sine wave. Note the fact that the wave is continuous; it just keeps going and going and going as long as there is still sound to strike the air. Digital audio, on the other hand, cannot be processed as a single wave. Before it can be understood by the computer, it needs to be broken down into consecutive chunks, known as samples, that each contain audio information. The total number of samples that are heard in one second is described by the term sampling rate or frequency, represented in hertz (Hz). The higher the sample rate, the greater the range of sound frequencies that can be reproduced in the sound file.</p>
      <p>Bit rate, on the other hand, refers essentially to how much digital audio information is being communicated per unit of time. While sampling rate affects frequency or pitch, bit rate has a more direct relationship with the loudness or softness of sound, i.e. the detail. The higher the bitrate, the more room there is for dynamic variation of sound; the lower the bitrate, the closer you get to binary (i.e., the mere presence or absence of sound – no volume involved).</p>
      <p>Both sampling rate and bit rate have a profound effect on the fidelity, a term used to describe how realistically sound is reproduced. It should be noted that while the undamaged human ear can only hear frequencies from about 20 to 20,000 Hz, the standard sampling rate for a stereo audio CD is 44,100 Hz. This is because the CD contains two actual sound sources – one for each ear, and each sampled at 22,050 Hz. This alone is more than the average human ear can perceive, but as you will see, there are advantages to working with high sample rates and bit rates.</p>

      <h3>The Microphone</h3>
      <p>If you are interested in recording your own sound for animated films, whether dialogue or sound effects, perhaps the first and most important investment you will make is in a microphone. No matter how fancy your audio suite is, it won’t make a lick of difference if you don’t have the means by which to accurately capture sound. A microphone is a type of transducer, which means a device that converts energy from one form to another. In the case of the mic, it is converting acoustic energy (sound) into electrical energy that goes to your computer.</p>
      <p>There are two main types of microphones that are of particular interest here, dynamic and condenser mics. Dynamic microphones are generally less sensitive, less expensive, and have lower quality than condenser microphones, but they also are much more resilient to damage. These are the type of microphones that are commonly used for karaoke or PA systems. Condenser microphones, on the other hand, are found more commonly in recording studios or radio stations, and typically have better quality. They also require something that is called phantom power in order to operate; this is a 48-volt current that is supplied to the microphone from the recorder or console.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the first most important thing to look for when buying a microphone is the frequency response. This is the range of frequencies that can be picked up by your microphone; the greater the better! Many high-end condenser microphones will have a range of 20-20,000 Hz, while dynamic microphones may have significantly less.</p>
      <p>The second thing to watch out for when purchasing a microphone is the mic’s self-noise level (SNL), expressed in decibels (dB) or dB-A (don’t worry about what that means). Even the best microphones will have some degree of unwanted sound or noise present, but if it is insignificant enough – and if you more microphone is amplified properly – this should be almost unnoticeable. For our purposes, a lower SNL is better.</p>
      <p>The third most important thing to look for in a mic is the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), also expressed in decibels (dB). This is the microphone’s sensitivity, a comparison of the volume of the sound you are trying to record to the volume of the background noise that you do not want to record. For the most part, a higher SNR is better.</p>
      <p>A final consideration when buying your microphone is that of the mic’s pickup pattern (technically called polar response). This is the way in which that particular microphone physically captures sound around it, and the best pickup pattern for you may vary depending on what you are recording. A common pickup pattern for a microphone is omnidirectional, which means that the mic picks up sound with equal sensitivity in all directions. A cardioid mic will pick up sound mainly from the front. Some (more expensive) microphones, such as the Samson C03U, have switcheable pickup patterns, and this might be a good solution if you only want to buy one microphone.</p>
      <p>Before you even buy a microphone, you will want to think about preamplification. A microphone by itself will only put out a relatively quiet signal if plugged directly into your computer’s soundcard, and will most likely have a high SNL when unamplified. The solution is to either purchase a USB microphone (a condenser microphone that is powered by the computer), or to purchase a console with a preamp for your microphone. Consoles come in all shapes and sizes, with and without phantom power, and many will have more than one place to plug in a microphone. The disadvantage of using a USB microphone or computer console system is that this setup is liable to pick up a great deal of noise from your computer if you aren’t careful.</p>

      <h3>More Technical Stuff</h3>
      <p>If you recent recordings have been plagued by electrical interference and hum, fear no more. The secret to avoiding this sort of noise in your recordings is to make sure that your wiring configuration is shielded. Shielded wiring cheats the interference by using a third conductor in the audio cable, a metal or foil braid that is tightly wrapped around the signal wire, which effectively shorts out any interference before it reaches your audio equipment. Even better is balanced wiring, which goes a step further by having two inner conductors wrapped around each other and the shield as a non-conductor. If this sounds complicated, don’t worry. Here’s a look at some common types of audio component wiring:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A typical 1/4 inch TS (Tip, Sleeve) plug. Can carry 1 channel of audio (mono), and is shielded.</li>
        <li>A typical 1/4 inch TRS (Tip, Ring, Sleeve) plug. Can carry 2 channels of audio (stereo) and is balanced and shielded.</li>
        <li>An XLR connector. Balanced, shielded. Can carry 1 channel of audio from a dynamic or condenser microphone.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Generally, a TRS connector will be at the very least shielded, but this is not always safe to assume. Furthermore, an audio chain is only as strong as its weakest link, meaning that if one component is unbalanced, the entire configuration is unbalanced.</p>
      <p>(By the way, you might have noticed the terms “mono”, “stereo”, and “channel” above. What does all this mean? Well, contrary to popular opinion, mono does NOT mean “sound in one ear”. It means that there is only one channel of audio – one signal. Think of it as if you cover up your right ear and listen just out of your left. A mono audio track can still be heard in each ear, but you will hear the same sound in both. A stereo audio track contains two channels of slightly-different sounding audio that are also heard in each ear. Furthermore, stereo can be “mono summed”, or converted to 1 channel, but mono cannot be converted back to stereo.)</p>

      <h3>Recording</h3>
      <p>Once you have a good microphone and/or recording console, you will probably want to invest a bit of money in some software for recording your dialogue. If you are just starting out, this may not be entirely necessary – there is plenty of freeware available on the Internet, and there might already be some included with your computer! One of the best programs for recording dialogue, however, is Audacity. It is free, and will more than suit your needs if you are just getting started with creating your own audio tracks.</p>
      <p>Recording, however, is not as simple as just hitting the button and speaking your lines. A microphone with a pop filter or grid will prevent “plosives”, or bursts of air on the audio that occur when you speak closely to the microphone. Furthermore, if you are using a condenser microphone, which tend to be more sensitive, it is a good idea to get a shockmount for the mic that will prevent bumps and crashes on your recording whenever you walk across the room or someone sets something down. Finally, a good-quality mic stand will let you position the mic exactly where you need it for your recording. For these items, I recommend the following sites: <a href="http://www.markertec.com" target="_blank">www.markertec.com</a> or <a href="www.sweetwater.com" target="_blank">http://www.sweetwater.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Unless you are working in a soundproofed studio, there will be a bit of reverb on whatever you record with your microphone in your room. This can be avoided by (a) filling your room with acoustically-absorbent material (pillows, towels, mattresses) or by (b) recording elsewhere. Another solution is to simply speak closer to the microphone, but this results in a phenomenon known as the proximity effect, where the voice sounds unnaturally low and close. It’s an effect that is heard often on amateur podcasts or video narration.</p>
      <p>While reading lines, your actors should be approximately three to five feet from the microphone; if they are holding a script, make sure that you don’t pick up the sound of the sheets on the recording! Also, if you are having a hard time getting lines to sound natural, try having your voice actors read while standing up; this can dramatically affect the sound of their voices. If the script calls for lines which need to be read loudly, make sure that you adjust the input level of your recorder or software so that the audio does not become distorted.</p>

      <h3>Field Recording</h3>
      <p>If you are interested in doing more than just recording voices, you may at some point consider investing in a field recorder, a portable unit for recording sound away from a computer. These are available in all colors and sizes and price ranges, each with a vast array of unique features. For your purposes, you will generally want to avoid the “voice dictation” recorders that are seen in electronics shops; these typically have poor quality and many do not offer external microphone input. Some units offer phantom power, others don’t; some include lossless file formats (see below), and others do not. If you are considering buying one, take your time and decide what is best for you. Here are some things to check for:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Phantom power</li>
        <li>Mono/stereo</li>
        <li>Battery life</li>
        <li>User replaceable battery</li>
        <li> File formats</li>
        <li>Memory</li>
        <li>Input types</li>
        <li>If all else fails, read the reviews!!!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What Format?</h3>
      <p>A question asked by many users getting into digital audio is what format they should use to record and save their sounds. This will vary largely depending on your operating system. For Windows, Windows Waveform or WAV is the standard; for Mac, it is Audio Interchange File Format, or AIFF. Both of these formats are uncompressed, which means that the analog audio source is encoded digitally with no reduction of information. The reason audio compression is used is because it makes it easier to distribute digital audio files online, but for the most part, compression should be done during the final stages of post-production. Compression has two types: lossy and lossless. Lossy compression reduces filesize by actually removing data from the file, and lossless compression reduces filesize by eliminating redundancy in the data. Examples of lossy audio formats include MPEG Layer-3 (MP3) and Windows Media Audio (WMA). Lossless compression codecs include the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC).</p>
      <p>With digital sound, you should obviously always aim for the highest quality material available (within reason), and this is best done by recording uncompressed audio in the initial takes. An industry standard for WAV and AIFF is 44,100 Hz at 16-bit. However, 24-bit has become more common in recent years, and may be a good choice if your system supports it. Keep in mind, however, that the sound is only ever as good as the source!</p>
