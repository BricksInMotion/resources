      <h2>Sound Effects</h2>
      <h3><small>Article by Justin & Josh Whitted</small></h3>
      <p><em>So, you have a great story, awesome animation, and some sweet visual effects, but your film just isn't delivering the message that you hoped for. You need sound effects, a part of brickfilming that is just as important as the visuals.</em></p>

      <p>Sound effects really make a film. Even if you aren't good at animation, sound effects can really boost the quality of your film. To start creating some realistic sounds for your films, you need to know the different ways of creating sounds.</p>

      <h3>Pre-recorded</h3>
      <p>Pre-recorded sounds are sounds that can be found on the internet. Though many sites provide sounds, I would advise using a site that does not copywright their sounds. A really good site for non-copywrighted sounds is FindSounds.com. You can also use the BiM Sound Library, but you must remember to give them credit.</p>

      <h3>Self-created</h3>
      <p>Self-created sounds are sounds that you created yourself. These are the sounds that I would advise to use, but, they can be the most unprofessional. To create professional-like sounds, you really should have a microphone with decent quality. You should also have a program like audacity that is meant for editing and manipulating sounds. Also, when recording your homemade sounds, be sure that there is no background noise. A really good sound can be ruined by an annoying background noise.</p>

      <p>Now that you have chosen and created your sounds, you need to combine them with your animation. This part is probably the most important in the entire sound effects process. To make sure that your sound is delivered in the right way and at the right place, make sure that your sound is in sync to your animation. When you edit, make sure that your animation starts when your sound starts and that it ends when your sound ends. Once you have edited all of your footage, your film should be ready to be published. I hope that this tutorial helped. Keep on animating!</p>
