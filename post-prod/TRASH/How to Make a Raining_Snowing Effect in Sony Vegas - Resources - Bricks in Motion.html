 <div class="introstuff"><p>A short tutorial on how to easily make a raining/snowing effect in Sony Vegas. </p></div><div class="section-content"><p>If you'd like to create some nice raining/snowing effects, you can now easily in Sony Vegas. <br>If
 you do not know what Sony Vegas is, it's very good and simple editing 
software that most brickfilmers use. You may download it and have a 
license for a month, and then you can just easily buy it (not very 
expensive, usually around 50 dollars). <br>So now that you have gotten 
Sony Vegas, and you know how to use it, I will show you how to create a 
very nice raining/snowing effect. </p><p><strong>Step 1</strong></p><p>So first off, as usual, make a new project; you do that by clicking on "Project" &gt; "New...". <br>Now,
 just simply insert your clip into the timeline. You do this by clicking
 on "Project" &gt; "Import Media...". Your clip should appear in the 
"Project Media" section, and to put it in the timeline you just simply 
drag it into the "Video" section in the timeline. <br><span class="postimg"><img src="How%20to%20Make%20a%20Raining_Snowing%20Effect%20in%20Sony%20Vegas%20-%20Resources%20-%20Bricks%20in%20Motion_files/SVRaingingSnowingEffectTutorialPic1.webp" alt="http://i1106.photobucket.com/albums/h364/sfugity/SVRaingingSnowingEffectTutorialPic1.png"></span></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p><p>The
 next thing you want to do, is to go to your "Media Generators" section,
 pick the "Starry Sky" icon, and drag it into the "Video Overlay" 
section in your timeline, so it's right above your clip. Now, as you 
have dragged that into your timeline, a setting for the "Starry Sky" 
icon should appear. And you just want to play with the colors and stuff 
like that (I suggest making the color of the dots white). Below the 
settings of the color of the dots, there should be a color B icon - you 
want to drag that to the lowest, to make the black background 
transparent. <br><span class="postimg"><img src="How%20to%20Make%20a%20Raining_Snowing%20Effect%20in%20Sony%20Vegas%20-%20Resources%20-%20Bricks%20in%20Motion_files/SVRainingSnowingEffectPic2.webp" alt="http://i1106.photobucket.com/albums/h364/sfugity/SVRainingSnowingEffectPic2.png"></span><br>Now,
 still in the "Starry Sky" settings, if you want it to be a snow effect,
 you can leave it just as the dots. But if you want it to be a raining 
effect, then you need obviously make the dots looking like drops of 
water. To do that, you need to play a bit with the settings on the left 
side. <br><span class="postimg"><img src="How%20to%20Make%20a%20Raining_Snowing%20Effect%20in%20Sony%20Vegas%20-%20Resources%20-%20Bricks%20in%20Motion_files/SVRainingSnowingEffectPic3.webp" alt="http://i1106.photobucket.com/albums/h364/sfugity/SVRainingSnowingEffectPic3.png"></span></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong></p><p>And
 once the rain looks like you want it to be, in your timeline, make the 
raining clip's length the same as your clip's. Then, still in the 
"Starry Sky" settings, you need to drag the line in the "Noise Texture" 
timeline (in the "Starry Sky" settings) all the way to the end, and drag
 the line in "Progress (in degrees)" all the way to the end. <br><span class="postimg"><img src="How%20to%20Make%20a%20Raining_Snowing%20Effect%20in%20Sony%20Vegas%20-%20Resources%20-%20Bricks%20in%20Motion_files/SVRainingSnowingEffectPic4.webp" alt="http://i1106.photobucket.com/albums/h364/sfugity/SVRainingSnowingEffectPic4.png"></span><br>Now
 you should be pretty much finished. Although, if your clip isn't as big
 as the raining clip, (like in these picture examples) then just simply 
make the raining clip size smaller. You do that by clicking on the 
"Event/Pan Crop" icon that is on your raining clip in the timeline, and 
make it smaller in the settings. </p><p><strong>Usefull Suggestions</strong></p><p>I
 strongly suggest when you're filming a raining scene that you put some 
drops water on your set and minifigures, because it makes the film look 
more realistic. If it's with snow, then use something that looks like 
snow (sugar etc.). Cleaning it up isn't usually a problem at all, mainly
 not with water. And a lots of brickfilmers actually use this technique,
 if they're doing a raining/snowing scene (ex: Unrenewable by Philip 
Heinrich, The Magician's Hat by Jack Bond). I also suggest making the 
lighting a bit darker, as when it's raining it's not exactly sunny 
outside. </p><p>So that should be about it. After you're done with the clip, just view it and simply render it. </p><p>Thank you for reading, and have a good day!</p><p>P.S. The animation example in the pictures wasn't a test for raining/snowing effect. </p><p>-sfugity-</p></div></div>    </div>
