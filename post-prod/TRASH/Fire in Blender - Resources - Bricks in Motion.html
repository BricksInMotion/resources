<p></p><div class="section"><a name="1"><strong>Introduction</strong></a></div><p></p>
<p>(Just a quick note before we begin! I am using 2.49 in this tutorial 
because I’m far more comfortable with it then I am with 2.5, and once I 
get a bit more familiar with 2.5 I will make this tutorial for it also.)</p>
<p></p><div class="section"><a name="2"><strong>Beginning</strong></a></div><p></p>
<p>Okay, the first and most obvious step is to open up Blender to the 
default scene. Hit ‘a’ twice and hit ‘x’ to delete everything in the 
scene. Now we have a blank slate to work with. Then add a circle to your
 scene. The default 32 vertices is fine, but if you want more or less, 
it’s all up to you. Select ‘Fill’, and then hit ok and you have your 
circle in your scene.</p>
<p></p><div class="section"><a name="3"><strong>Particle System</strong></a></div><p></p>
<p>Second thing’s second, so go to the Particle Buttons in the Object 
panel. Add a particle system and name it Fire. Change the amount of 
particles to 6,500 or so, set the start to -50, set the end to 250. 
Change the life of the particles to 42, and the random to 0.55. You can 
change these settings to whatever you want them to be, but unless you 
want the animation to play the flames suddenly bursting up from nowhere,
 make sure to have the start to be in the negatives enough for the 
average particle to have already died. Change the particles to emit from
 Random, because fire is for the most part, well, random. Now, set the 
random 0.07. So far, it seems like nothing’s really happening, but with 
this next step you can see the method to my madness. Make the Z 
acceleration 4.4, and suddenly the particles rise! It’s like magic, 
except better! Now switch the visualization to object. We’re going to 
come back to this later, but for now you can ignore it.</p><p>&nbsp; 
&nbsp; We’re going to be using an object to base our particle system off
 of. This has multiple advantages: We can animate the size of the 
object, so the particles will die off as they rise upwards. I got this 
idea from a tutorial I found once on fire in Blender, and though I 
though some things they did could have been improved, this was a really 
awesome idea, and it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p></p><div class="section"><a name="4"><strong>Making a Particle</strong></a></div><p></p>
<p>Without further ado, switch your view to layer 2 and add a UVsphere. 
It doesn’t need to be very high quality; about 6 segments and 6 rings 
will be just fine. Make it set smooth, and do whatever else you want to 
do with it, then go over to the Materials panel. Add a new material, and
 make the color of the object the same color you want your fire to be. 
I’m going to make green fire in this tutorial, because quite frankly I’m
 really tired of rendering out lots of orange fires. Make the 
specularity color a lighter version of that color, just for a bit better
 look, though again, it really won’t matter at all because when we 
composite the flame you won’t be able to tell the difference. Make the 
alpha low, about 0.3, and enable Z transparency. Another good idea I got
 from the tutorial is to enable VCol lighting. Make the specularity and 
harness very high, because fire is bright. An important thing to do is 
to keep in mind that we are basing all of these physical attributes off 
of real fire. If you’re ever stuck, think...”What would real fire look 
like?”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now hit ‘n’ to bring up the transform 
properties, and make the X, Y, and Z scales of the object 0.02. Insert a
 scale keyframe, and move up about 1/3 of how long the average particle 
lasts. We set ours to 32, so go up to frame 14 or 15 and change the 
scale value to 0.1 and add another keyframe. Then go to frame 42, the 
last frame, and make the particle very small, about 0.001, or possibly 
something even smaller. Keyframe it again, and you have your animated 
particle. You can adjust the curve of the IPOs if you want to, but I 
think that with what we’re doing it’s just more work than it’s worth.</p>
<p></p><div class="section"><a name="5"><strong>Putting it Together</strong></a></div><p></p>
<p>From here, go back to layer 1 and select the circle spewing out 
particles again. Under the particle buttons, make the object name 
whatever you named your UVsphere. Now play back the animation and see 
what you have. If it looks like the particles die out too quickly, then 
just adjust the life and keyframes for the particles.</p><p>&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Now add a lamp, and make the brightness about 1.1, and change the
 distance amount to 5,000. Then position the lamp wherever you want it 
to be. I put mine a bit up and to the right, so that the particles would
 be lit at an angle.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Add a camera. Position it 
wherever you want, it’s really just a matter of personal preference. I 
want to have a straight on shot, so I moved it back on the Y axis and a 
bit up on the Z axis. Go to the Render Panel now, and change sky to key,
 RGB to RGBA, and make the image type .png so that it can handle 
transparency. Then specify you camera size. Hit render, and...”This 
isn’t fire. Hey, you tricked me BG! You said this was a tutorial about 
creating fire, not a bunch of spheres!”</p>
<p></p><div class="section"><a name="6"><strong>Compositing</strong></a></div><p></p>
<p>That may be correct, be we’re not finished yet. If you have After 
Effects or another program that you want to do your compositing in, 
awesome! You get to do the last bit in there and exit Blender after you 
render your video. But if you still want to use Blender for the 
compositing, then go to the node editor, go to Composite Nodes, and hit 
Use Nodes. Then you can fiddle around with warping the image and 
re-layering it on with the Mix node (switched to add) that will make up 
about half you nodes. Once you’ve fiddled around with it and have 
something you like, render out a test frame, then if you still like it, 
render the animation.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The reason we made it over a 
transparent background is that if you used your background movie 
sequence/picture, when you applied the nodes you would distort the raw 
movie clip you imported. The solution, if you want to do it in Blender, 
is at the end of your nodes, put an image/movie node in, and put the 
fire in front of it. Turn on the Do Composite button, and you’re set in 
silver and ready to render it out!</p>
<p></p><div class="section"><a name="7"><strong>Conclusion</strong></a></div><p></p>
<p>You might notice in this tutorial I’m not exact about a lot of 
things, and the main purpose of this is to get you to think about how 
you want to do this yourself, and to create something unique to you and 
your project. Toy around with the particle settings, number of particle 
systems, material, and nodes and see what you come up with!</p><p><em>(No, this tutorial isn’t copyrighted, but please respect it. I did spend a while making it after all.)</em></p>
