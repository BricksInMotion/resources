      <h2>Choosing the Right Music</h2>
      <h3><small>Article by Jacob Jumper</small></h3>
      <p><em>In this article you will learn how to pick that perfect piece that gives your film the mood you want.</em></p>

      <p>If you watch a great movie, or play a good video game, you might note that the musical score is often what sets it apart from others in it's class. Horror films often are the best example, with music often replacing dialogue. Video games like The Legend of Zelda and Amnesia are also great examples of setting the mood with music.</p>

      <p>But how do you know what music to use, and when?</p>

      <p>Tone is how the author, or director wants the piece to feel. If you want to create a scene where the sun is shinning, and children are frolicking, choose an uplifting piece that makes you smile! If the scene is very deep and upsetting, use a slow, somber piece. It gets deeper than that, but basically, if you want the film to feel a certain way, choose a piece that makes you feel that way.</p>

      <p>Music can also be used to foreshadow or to warn. Usually in horror films, you hear an unsettling tone, moments before the killer pops out of the closet and kills a person. Think Jaws. A shark is approaching. "Dun dun. Dun Dun. Dundun. Dundundundundundun." Boom! No more person.</p>

      <p>Just try and pick the music that you imagine playing when you're writing the film. Have fun with it.</p>
