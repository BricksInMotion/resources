      <h2>How to Make Cartoony Gun-Flares in Photo Shop</h2>
      <h3><small>Article by Harrison Allen</small></h3>
      <p><em>Here's some step-by-step instructions for making somewhat cartoony flares in Adobe Photo Elements (may work with other editors, I don't know). The idea is that since brickfilms are not very realistic, it might, in some cases, be a nice alternative to have some more cartoon looking flares for your movie instead of using stock footage.</em></p>

      <p>Here is the finished product:</p>

      http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/263253_262958533718334_100000125687436_1283151_598958_n.jpg

      <p>I'll go through this step by step.</p>

      <p>Step 1: Take the picture. (Har har)</p>
      http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/268603_262983543715833_100000125687436_1283184_4201411_n.jpg

      <p>Just animate some shot with your character shooting. In the desired flare-frame, shine a light on your character from the direction the gun is firing. I like to use red light, because it looks cartoon like. However if you with to be more realistic, shine a more yellow regular torch/flashlight on it, and mentally replace every time I say red with your chosen color appropriately.</p>

      <p>Step 2: Add a red spot.</p>
      http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/262483_262983913715796_100000125687436_1283189_4799832_n.jpg

      <p>IMPORTANT: create a new layer first.
      Just take the paint tool, set it to normal with a brush with faded edges, set it to the appropriate size, and click at the end of the gun three times.</p>

      <p>Step 3: Add the white spot.</p>
      http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/206088_262983847049136_100000125687436_1283188_7776016_n.jpg

      <p>Same thing with the last step, but change the color to white and click just once.</p>

      <p>Step 4: Smudge.</p>
      http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/281673_262983773715810_100000125687436_1283187_5745084_n.jpg

      <p>Use the smudge tool several times to make a flare shape. It's quite simple.
      And make sure you have created a new layer before adding the flares like I mentioned in the second step, or else you will stretch the image in the background, and that just looks bad.  He he.
      Now save your image as a JPG.</p>

      <p>Step 5: Lens Flare.</p>
      http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/228888_262983693715818_100000125687436_1283186_4594800_n.jpg

      <p>Open the thing back up, and add a lens flare by clicking "Filter" then the "Render" sub-folder, and select lens flare, just put it on the gun flare, and select the size you like best.
      Then use the Dodge Tool with a large brush with faded edges to brighten the flare and a tiny bit of the surrounding area. Then the same thing with the brush tool set to color to ad a bit of extra red.
      (This entire step may be left out if you wish, as the flare looks okay without it, but it's still nice)

      <p>Step 6: Mini-flare.</p>
      http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/281938_262983627049158_100000125687436_1283185_2438942_n.jpg

      <p>In every frame after the big flare, make a mini-flare by putting a bit of white at the end of the gun, adding some red color, then brighten with the dodge tool.

      <p>And so concludes my explanation for my flares. :)
      I hope this was somehow useful of enlightening for you. And I hope you use it in your films. :3
      Thanks for reading.</p>
