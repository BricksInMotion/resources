      <h2>Post-Production - A Basic Rundown</h2>
      <h3><small>Article by BuilderBrothers</small></h3>
      <p><em>The last stage in the Brickfilming process.  In this stage, all the “goodies” are added to your animation that really make it stand out and seem professional.</em></p>

      <h4>Special Effects</h4>
      <p>Special effects are all the effects (such as lightsaber glow and laser fire) that are added to your Brickfilm after it has been filmed. It is important though that you do not go “overboard,” so to speak, when you are adding effects. A film does not need a lot of effects to be good. In fact, a well-animated film with very little or no special effects is normally appreciated more than a film with hundreds of effects and poor animation. Of course, in some cases, it is necessary that you add lots of special effects to a shot, such as if you were having some Jedi fight off an army of clones. Though we will not go over all the effects that can be used in Brickfilms (there are hundreds), we will explain a few of the most common.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><em>Chroma Keying</em> – This is also known as either Blue-screening or Green- screening. What basically happens is two shots (a backround shot and the main shot) are layered. Then a certain color in the main shot is selected (such as blue or green), and the color is then erased, leaved the backround image showing. Blue backrounds are normally considered the best when it comes to Brickfilming, being that they are unlikely colors that you would actully have anywhere else in your shot. Chroma Keying is normally handy if you want to create a false backround for a movie, such as in Star Wars.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><em>CGI</em> – This stands for “Computer-Generated-Imagery.” (This actually is not really normally considered a special effect, but for this guide we placed it under this category because there was not really any other place to put it.) It is used in Brickfilms (and real films) to make elaborate shots that cannot be done with regular animation and props. It is often even used on its own (like with Pixar) to make full-length movies. Normally though, when it comes to Brickfilms, it is used as a way to do shots or build props that you either don’t have the pieces for or would be impossible to animate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><em>Lightsabers/Lasers</em> – There are a variety of ways to do these effects. Probably the effect that gives the best results is actually taking a shot of your film and editing each picture individually in a image-editing program (such as GIMP or Photoshop). You could also opt for using a program specially designed for that kind of effect (such as LSMaker). There are many tutorials available for both techniques.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><em>Muzzle Flashes/Explosions</em> – There are also a wide variety of ways in which to do these effects. The technique used the most often though is going to a site with free muzzle flashes and explosion footage (such as detonationfilms.com) and simple inserting and positioning the footage in your film. The other technique though is actually drawing a muzzle flash for your gun on an image-editing program (such as GIMP or Photoshop). Either technique you use though, you must experiment and work a while to get a good result.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><em>Masking</em> – This is a technique that is quite common in Brickfilms, as well as other animations. Basically, what masking does is simply make it seem like your LEGO bricks are suspended in the air with nothing holding them there. This can be a very useful effect in many cases, especially in lightsaber battles. What is done is that you take two images of the same scene. One acts as the background image, and the other acts as the foreground image. The background image does not have the object you want falling, and therefore no supports either. The foreground image, on the other hand, has the falling object and the supports. What you simply do is layer them (with the background in back and foreground in front) and then erase the supports. Since you had the background image behind the foreground image, it should seem as if your brick is really falling. It is very important though that you make sure that the lighting is the same in both images. If the lighting is different, then you will see a sort of “shadow” where the support you erased was. Once again though, if you truly want a good effect, then you have to practice and experiment a lot.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Sound Effects</h4>
      <p>Sound effects help to not only add realism to your Brickfilm, but also to help make your Brickfilm seem either comic or serious. For example, if it was a serious film, a man falling off a building would just have a swish and maybe a scream. If it was a comedy, a man falling off a building would have a “whoop” and possibly an accompanied “oof!” Having more or less sound effects can also either help or detract from your film. For example, some shots in your film might have a lot of action and things going on. This type of shot would most likely need more sounds than a shot of a man sitting on a bench in a park. Some people opt for having virtually no sounds, even in busy shots. This is OK too, but you need to be careful about what sounds you choose to use and which ones you leave out. There are a lot of places on the Internet to get free sounds (like FindSounds.com and FreeSounds.com), and if you can’t find a sound you want anywhere on the Internet, then simply record the sound yourself or ask a friend to!</p>

      <h4>Music</h4>
      <p>Choosing music to use in Brickfilms can often be one of the hardest things to do in the process of Brickfilming. Choosing the right or wrong music can totally change the way your Brickfilm is seen by your audience. For example, you wouldn’t have happy music in a sad scene or sad music in a happy scene. Music in fact is sometimes considered one of the top things that determines whether or not your Brickfilm is good or not. Wrong music in a Brickfilm can totally ruin it for your audience. There are a few places to get free music on the Internet, but most of them are copywritten. A good site to get free non-copywritten music from is Incompetech.com. There are also several programs available on the Internet that enable you to write your own music. Almost all of these programs though cost a bit of money.</p>

      <h4>Voiceovers/Casting</h4>
      <p>In your Brickfilm, you probably have some talking between your minifigs. You could always record your own voice for all the figs, and then tweak your voice to sound different for each character, but this technique almost always has fairly low-quality results. The best plan of action to take is to assemble a cast. Real people most likely all have very different voices, and will sound much better than your own voice tweaked. It is important though that your cast knows <span class="bbu">exactly</span> how they are supposed to sound and what emotions they should show. If you don’t, you will get a lot of different voices of people just blindly and emotionlessly reciting lines. It is also good to let them know the story behind your film, so they know how to really “be” the character they are voicing for. Good voice-actors can really make your Brickfilm seem realistic and professional.</p>

      <h4>Widescreen/Letterboxing</h4>
      <p>When you are done with your film, it will probably be just 800x600 or 640x480, which is 4:3 format. You might want to have widescreen though. The normal widescreen ratio is 16:9. To do this, you have to do some cropping and some math. You have to do math to figure out just how much you need to crop off the top and bottom of your video. The mathematical equation is explained below.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Take the width of your video (the first number) and divide it by 16. For this tutorial, we will be using an 800x600 video. The number we will therefore get is 50.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Take this new number (in our case 50) and multiply it by 9. This gives us 450.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Take this number and subtract it from the height (the second number). This gives us 150.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Take this number and divide it by two. This gives us (in our case) 75. This is the exact amount you need to crop off the top and bottom of your video. You don’t necessarily need to cut off the exact amount on both the top and bottom, just as long as the combined sum of the numbers is the same (in our case 150). This is handy if you accidentally filmed a shot too high or two low to crop.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Now that your video is (hopefully) widescreen, you can either choose to keep it this way or letterbox it. Letterboxing is when you add black bars to the top and bottom of your widescreen video to make it uncropped again, so to speak. A good free program to do both widescreen cropping and letterboxing is <a href="http://www.virtualdub.org/" target="_blank">VirtualDub</a>. There are also several very helpful tutorials on this subject available on the Internet.</p>

      <h4>Sharing your Videos</h4>
      <p>Your Brickfilm is now all done! You’ve prepared it, filmed it, and edited it. Now you can choose to either keep your film on the computer for you and your friends only, or upload it to a video or media-hosting site on the Internet. If you choose to upload it, then you should follow these steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Choose a site to upload it to. YouTube is the most common site for this, but Vimeo is also very commonly used.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Render your video in a format of your choice. The most common video formats are WMV and MPG.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Upload it to the site you chose.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Copy the link to the video and give the link to people so that people all over the world can see your films!</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
