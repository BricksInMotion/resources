          <div class="introstuff"><p>The second stage when Brickfilming is the production stage.&nbsp; The production stage is possibly one of the hardest and most time consuming stages of Brickfilming.</p></div><div class="section-content"><p><strong><em>Preparing a shot</em></strong><br>There are several things you must do before you begin to film a shot for your Brickfilm.<br></p><ul><li><p>Make sure your props and sets are taped down.&nbsp; This avoids set bumps, which are something that you should never do.&nbsp; Duck-Tape or sticky-tack are both very useful when trying to steady a set.&nbsp; Even LEGO bricks themselves can help support and keep a set or prop steady.</p></li><li><p>Make sure your camera is plugged in and your filming software is open.&nbsp; Some software requires you to plug in your camera first and then open the software, while others require the opposite.&nbsp; You should find out which technique to use before you begin to film.&nbsp; There are several free capture software programs available, but the best of them you normally have to buy.&nbsp; “Monkey Jam” is the highest rated free Brickfilming capture software.</p></li><li><p>Make sure your camera is firmly placed and locked in position.&nbsp; This will help you avoid camera bumps, which, like set bumps, are something you do NOT want.&nbsp; Often Brickfilmers will construct tripods or frames for their camera, so that they can even pan or dolly if they want to.&nbsp; These also help to keep your camera fixed in a particular position.</p></li><li><p>Make sure your camera is in focus.&nbsp; A nice crisp and sharp image is something that can really make your film be considered high quality.&nbsp; Some cameras have a focus ring, which you can turn to adjust the focus.&nbsp; Most cameras though have to be adjusted on the computer program itself.&nbsp; Once again, make sure that you have a camera with manual focus.&nbsp; “Auto” and “Fixed” focus are no-nos.</p></li><li><p>Make sure your lights are all positioned.&nbsp; It is very important that you have good lighting in your Brickfilms.&nbsp; Good lighting not only improves camera quality, but it also makes your shot look more as if it were shot at the daytime.&nbsp; <strong><span style="\&quot;color:" red\"="">DO NOT EVER USE NATURAL LIGHT!]</span></strong>&nbsp; Natural light is not even or constant, and will almost always cause major light-flickers (which are big no-nos).&nbsp; When filming, make sure there is no natural light coming into your room.&nbsp; It is normally good to use at least two lights but three is the norm.&nbsp; Use one light as the main light, one light for the backdrop, and one light to take care of all unwanted shadows.&nbsp; If you want to film a night scene, do NOT turn off the lights.&nbsp; Instead, go into the settings for your camera and turn down the brightness and contrast.&nbsp; Turning off the lights will only result in disaster!</p></li><li><p>Make sure you choose what “Frames Per Second” (FPS) you want to animate at.&nbsp; The norm for Brickfilming is 15 fps, but lots of people often film at 12 fps.&nbsp; A few (very) dedicated Brickfilmers even animate at 24 fps!&nbsp; 15 or 12 fps will probably work best for you, though.</p></li></ul><p>Don’t be worried if it takes you several hours to set up a shot.&nbsp; Taking a lot of time preparing a shot is a sign of a good Brickfilmer.&nbsp; Getting the perfect shot will make your films much more enjoyable and professional looking.<br>___________________________________</p><p><strong><em>Filming a shot</em></strong><br>After you have taken the time to prepare your shot, it is time to film it.&nbsp; When filming a shot, there are some very important things that you must keep in mind.<br></p><ul><li><p>Make sure there are no light flickers.&nbsp; Light-flickers are one of the most hated things in Brickfilming, and they make your lighting seem completely unrealistic.&nbsp; Make sure that your lighting is always the same in every picture of a scene.</p></li><li><p>Make sure there are no camera or set bumps.&nbsp; Once again, as was mentioned before, these bumps make your Brickfilms really seem amateurish.&nbsp; As was also mentioned earlier, make sure that the set and camera are firmly locked down in position 100% of the time.</p></li><li><p>Make sure that your animation is smooth.&nbsp; This is not only controlled by the FPS, but also how many pictures you take to complete a particular movement.&nbsp; For example, taking 6 pictures to move an arm instead of 3 pictures will make your animation seem smoother.</p></li><li><p>When animating, it is good to experiment with a variety of techniques.&nbsp; Some techniques will turn out better than others.&nbsp; Use only these techniques in the future.&nbsp; If you wanted to learn how to do a particular technique (such as easing in and out), then it would probably be good if you looked on the Internet for some good tutorials on the subject.&nbsp; You can even take someone else’s technique and modify it to suit yourself.</p></li><li><p>Make sure your animation is consistent.&nbsp; Do not make some of your animation slow and choppy while some of your animation is fast and smooth.&nbsp; Try to find what speed you animate at the best, and then try to stay at that speed the whole time.&nbsp; This does not mean that you should make a run sequence be slow like a walk sequence, but it means that you should always try to make the running the same speed whenever your minifig runs, and your walking the same speed whenever your minifig walks.</p></li></ul></div></div>
