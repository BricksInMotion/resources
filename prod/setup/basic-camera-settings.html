      <h2>Basic Camera Settings for Optimal Quality and Minimal Light Flicker</h2>
      <h3><small>Article by BWJC</small></h3>
      <p><em>Always wanted to know what settings to use but weren't quite sure?  Have you had problems with light flicker and think it may be your camera settings? Well you have come to the right place. This article runs over some basic settings for eliminating light flicker, and some practical uses for each of the settings.</em></p>

      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>First off, not all camera's will have all these settings, these are only for optimum picture quality. If you can't find a setting I talked about, then don't worry about it. The most important thing is to always have your camera on as manual settings as you can get. Here are the basic settings used in general stop-motion, remember to adjust for the look you want.

      <ul>
        <li>Manual Focus - helps eliminate flicker and overall very useful</li>
        <li>ISO of around 100 - less grainy pictures</li>
        <li>An F-Stop/Aperture of about 20 - your field of focus</li>
        <li>A Shutter Speed between 1/4 and 1/10 - helps eliminate light flicker and set brightness</li>
        <li>A manual or custom White Balance(set based on colours in shot) - eliminate light flicker</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Focus</h4>
      <p>One of the most important parts of creating cinematographic films is how the focus of the camera i set, and how it changes. For some shots, you may want the camera to focus on something close, then move to something farther away. The only way to do this is with manual focus. I your camera doesn't have this function, I would seriously recommend getting one that does, as auto focus can cause an unwanted flicker, due to the focus changing.</p>
      <p>When focusing, always have the desired subject in focus the most, so if they are moving farther away, change the focus each picture to keep the desired subject in focus. You can also do focus changes from one object to another. When doing this use the rule 'ease in, ease out' and make each increment between that equal. This is not nearly as noticeable for focus as it is zoom, but still produces a better final product if you are more careful.</p>

      <h4>ISO</h4>
      <p>Some of you who have messed with the ISO setting on your camera may have noticed that the higher the ISO, the brighter the picture is. Now, I am not saying your video should be really dark when I say have it at 100, as some camera's go all the way up to 3200. Your lamps should be bright enough to still produce a nice image, even with a low ISO. Changing brightness isn't the only thing the ISO does, the higher the ISO, the grainier the picture is as well. Most of the time you should be able to adjust shutter speed and aperture to get the lighting results you want. Your ISO should always be fairly low, not getting much higher than 400. The only time you would want a high ISO is when you want the image grainy, and don't want too much post editing, but leaving it low is the smart way to go.</p>

      <h4>F-Stop/Aperture</h4>
      <p>An important part for your field of focus, as it controls how much will be in focus, and how much in focus the rest will be. What this changes is the size of the opening in the camera lens. The smaller the setting, the smaller the opening, the less light that can get in, the darker the image, and the less that will be in focus, and vice versa. I say about 20, as this setting, when matched with the other settings I gave you, gives a nice bright image with a large field of focus. Depending on what you want, this can be changed for a specific field of focus. If you want more things in focus, you can make it bigger, but if you wanted very little in focus, say for a focus change from one object to another, you can lower this. No matter what you set this to, the shutter speed can be set accordingly for the brightness you want, so choose your aperture wisely.</p>

      <h4>Shutter Speed</h4>
      <p>This allows you to change how long light is let into the camera for one picture. The reason you want a longer shutter speed is because lamps flicker slightly very fast. This becomes problematic when you have a fast shutter speed, as the light can change from picture to picture, causing light flicker. The longer the shutter speed, the less chance this will affect your film. Another great thing about shutter speed, is it can be changed greatly in either direction, to obtain the proper brightness you want. I wouldn't recommend going anywhere shorter than 1/60, as that is getting mighty close to causing flicker, and may prove problematic, but you can make the speed as long as you want, always to get exactly what you want. This and the aperture are very closely intertwined, and a change to one, normally means a change to another.</p>

      <h4>White Balance</h4>
      <p>The single most important thing for eliminating light flicker caused by camera settings. Most people think they can use a pre-made setting, such as 'cloudy' or 'tungsten' and that it will be fine, the settings won't change. WRONG. Even these settings will change, just like auto, they just limit the change to a general area. What you want is the manual or custom setting. This allows you to pick a setting and sick with it, no change at all. Completely controlled, just what you want for stop-motion.</p>
      <p>Most camera's will change it based on your selection of a neutral colour, which should usually be a light grey. The selection of this varies from camera to camera, but make sure when selecting you either put a light grey object in your shot to set by, or use an object in your set. This is of course to get basic colouring. If you want to make a scene more green, or more blue, etc. you can mess with settings, or edit in post production.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>These settings are based of the settings of the Canon T2i and will vary from camera to camera. Make sure you experiment with your camera to find the best settings for you. They will be similar to this, but not exact. Also, never change your settings in the middle of shooting. This would cause unwanted flicker.</p>
      <p>These settings are for optimum image clarity and quality. Remember that these will work the best if your camera is set to take pictures in highest quality.</p>
      <p>This is just a guide, not a rulebook, remember to experiment with settings to find what works for you.</p>
      <p>These are not perfect settings or descriptions by any account. Always research more if you want better information. Google is a great search engine.</p>
      <p>If your camera does not have these settings, then work with what you can change, and always remember to use <strong>every manual setting possible</strong>, as this will provide better results. Names of settings may vary, be aware of this.</p>
      <p>Always remember to set your lamps as well, camera settings aren't everything.</p>
