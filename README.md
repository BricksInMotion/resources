# BiM Resources Archive
> An archive for the Bricks in Motion resources section

## Brief

[Bricks in Motion](https://www.bricksinmotion.com/) is a friendly filmmaking community devoted to the art of stop-motion animation. During it's history, a collection of resources and interviews regarding brickfilm was collected and made available for anyone who wished to learn more about brickfilming.

Over the years, the resources subsection of the site became outdated and unmaintained. As part of a larger forum upgrade, the resources subsection was removed from the site, but the existing information was to be preserved for posterity purposes.

In that light, the purpose of this project is to provide a modern browsing experience for the BiM resources subsection, converting the original, database-driven code to a static website.
