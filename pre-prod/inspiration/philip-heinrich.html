      <p><strong>At Bricks in Motion we call you Sméagol, but you aren’t really a hobbit demented by a powerful ring from a fictional land…are you?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes, yes I am. A stoor, actually, as you may or may not know they lived mostly on the Gladden Fields just off the Anduin river. I mean…I’m a 21-year-old college student studying film and running this website in my free time.</p>

      <p><strong>So if you’re not Gollum, why did you choose the moniker Sméagol and how did you get introduced to the brickfilming community?</strong></p>
      <p>It was fifth grade. I’d just finished reading <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. It seemed like a good idea at the time.<br>Having been inspired by claymation films like <em>The Wrong Trousers</em>, I had been making short stop-motion animations with LEGO for a few years when LEGO Studios came out. After a little looking around on the internet I discovered Brickfilms in 2001 and came to realize that I wasn’t the only person making these films.</p>

      <p><strong>Better get out of the pool because it’s lightning round! Favorite brickfilmer?</strong></p>
      <p>Tough to say. I think Night Owl (Nikolas Jaeger) has a very unique approach and aesthetic to his films and I have enjoyed his work to date. I also enjoy KG (James Morr)'s unique humor, balanced with the great animation in his films.</p>

      <p><strong>Favorite brickfilm?</strong></p>
      <p>My favorite brickfilm is <em>Robota</em> by Marc Beurteaux. The sets and character construction are amazing, as well as the cinematography and storytelling. Everything works together well to create a compelling short film, it probably helps that it’s a unique film as well. I'm also partial to <em>Twelve Bucks</em> by Rob Weychert.</p>

      <p><strong>Yellow or fleshie?</strong></p>
      <p>Yellow minifigures, not only because I have more of them but also because they are more in line with the classic perception of what a LEGO minifigure should look like.</p>

      <p><strong>Butter or margarine?</strong></p>
      <p>Generally, butter. If I’m going to eat margarine on a piece of toast, it butter be good.</p>

      <p><strong>Favorite emote?</strong></p>
      <p><img src="../../site-images/resources/cheer.gif">, mostly because I couldn’t tell what was happening in it for a long time. I’m sad that BiM doesn’t have something like it.</p>

      <p><strong>Pixar or Dreamworks?</strong></p>
      <p>Need this be asked? Shrek the Third is the greatest animated feature film of our time. No seriously Pixar is pretty much uncontested here.</p>

      <p><strong>Favorite musician?</strong></p>
      <p>I’m big on classical music so Beethoven is a serious contender. But I also enjoy film scores, partial to Jerry Goldsmith.</p>

      <p><strong>YouTube or Vimeo?</strong></p>
      <p>YouTube. I post my videos on that site to get views, not a loving community of fellow filmmakers. That’s what BiM is for.</p>

      <p><strong>Favorite live-action film?</strong></p>
      <p>Not to be totally uncreative here, but Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is up there.<br>Babe: Pig in the City is a strong contender too, though.&nbsp; It's tough to pick a “favorite” film because there is so much variety within live action.</p>

      <p><strong>Could you give us a brief walkthrough of your "studio?"</strong></p>
      <p>Most all of the equipment I use is relatively affordable and common.<br>I shoot with a Canon Powershot A620. It isn’t compatible with most stop-motion software and I like to shoot at ludicrous resolutions like 2048 x 1536, so I attach it to the PC with a USB extension cord and shoot stills directly onto the computer using the remote capture software that comes with it. After the fact I usually sequence the images to 15 frames per second in VirtualDub.<br>I record sound effects and dialog with a Blue Snowball USB Microphone. The quality is good for vocal recordings and sounds, and working with a USB microphone takes out the hassle of needing a decent soundcard and a pre-amp to get good recordings.<br>My setup for shooting is really pretty simple, I don’t like having to move up and down a lot while filming so I put the set, which is built on top of a LEGO table, on top of a card table so it is high off the ground. I use a couple of 3-bulb nightstand type lamps to light it. Sometimes I use paper to soften the light a bit, in other cases I point the bulbs at the white ceiling so the light will bounce off of it. I use compact fluorescent bulbs, they give me good colors and flicker far less than incandescent bulbs.<br>And always remember to wear a dark colored t-shirt while filming. Cuts down on reflections.</p>

      <p><strong>We know who you are, now what do you think makes your films uniquely “you”?</strong></p>
      <p>That’s a tough question, I don’t think that I’ve yet developed a heavily established style that is consistent in all my films per se. I have noticed though, and others have mentioned, that I tend even in short films to let the story go at a fairly slow pace. With the exception of The Oven, which I had to fit into 2 minutes’ length for a contest and really had to work to make this feel natural in the film. I also try to be bold with effects shots and not cut corners in a way that looks like I’m cutting corners. Even if a short relies mostly on close, quickly filmed shots I make sure to take the time to include at least a few wider, more elaborate shots in every film to enhance the overall impression it leaves. In The Pepperonis, a THAC (24-Hour Animation Contest) entry, I had mostly close dialog shots, but included a high-angle, aerial shot that took me about 3 of the 24 hours, and another opening wide shot of the building that took a couple of hours as well. These two shots, in my view, really help sell the rest of the film and break up what could quickly become very visually monotonous.</p>

      <p><strong>What experiences or films, brickfilm or otherwise, have shaped this style?</strong></p>
      <p>I loved the Star Wars movies as a kid, I like films that have daring, grandiose visuals on some level. Not necessarily huge effects shots (though those are nice) but at least some of the kind of visuals that take advantage of the large scope possible in cinema. For the same reason I enjoyed Jay Silver’s shorts The Gauntlet and Rise of the Empire, they took this kind of cinematic scale and approach to brickfilming and it was something I wanted to aim for as well.</p>

      <p><strong>Your films have definitely garnered you a reputation for top notch computer generated effects. Do you think you could be where you are today without it, and could you make a film without the CG?</strong></p>
      <p>I recognize that in some of my videos, like Bane of the Sith, computer effects are one of the main focal points. In other cases, I think things like the CG work in Unrenewable could have been avoided -- though the film might have looked a little less open and smaller scale as a result since there are a lot of things I would not have been able to film practically.<br>I have done a few films with little or no CG, The Pepperonis for example only has a little keying for the sky in the opening shot. Although I use CG when I think it’ll look better than what I could do practically, I’m also generally careful not to use CG for things that would look better done practically and are feasible to do that way.</p>

      <p><strong>Now, one of your most well-known films, Unrenewable, definitely had some intensive digital manipulation, garnering it much praise, among the other aspects involved. What was the most challenging part in creating this film?</strong></p>
      <p>I was on a really tight deadline for that film due to the contest I was trying to finish it for, so getting everything together in the last few days was pretty hectic. By the end, I was going back and forth between filming, recording dialog, and scoring all in the same day for the last few days.<br>If I had to pick a single piece of the film it’d be the long downward dolly shot toward the beginning of the film. It was one of the first shots I started working on before filming began and it was the last one I finished as well. With the smoke, rain, and lens blur I ended up rendering a lot of different layers and having to do some work manually on each individual frame.</p>

      <p><strong>In Unrenewable and another one of your films, The Oven, a parody of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven” you crafted two wonderful soundtracks. What inspired you in the creation of this music?</strong></p>
      <p>It’s funny, the music for The Oven in some ways brought about the concept for the film – I wanted to make sort of a horror parody of some kind, something that would allow me to write some fun pipe organ music and when the contest came up I thought Poe might be good source material. I had written an organ piece for a music theory class in school recently so when I was nearly finished with editing the film I slapped it on top of the animation, optimistic that it would complement the animation well.<br>It didn’t fit, at all. Way too heavy and it just didn’t fit the mood of the rest of the film. I started over from scratch, using some lighter pizzicato string type sounds and some cello (all synthetic, but trying to stick to what I could get a realistic sound from) and came up with what ended up being the final track in a few hours. I did manage to work in a few bits of the melody from the original organ piece but ultimately it was much more effective to try to make something timed to the animation.<br>Unrenewable’s music came together a little differently. I wrote the script in December of 2007 and began thinking of music ideas shortly thereafter, knowing I wouldn’t film until summer. I wrote out a few bits and pieces but didn’t really try to work at it too much – after all, in February 2008 I started devoting my free time to writing a new, much larger project (Space Opera), and figured I’d get back to Unrenewable when I had some time to film it in the summer. <br>When I was about half done filming I began writing the music, all based around the melody I’d had in my head for months by that point. I found it worked at a fast, upbeat tempo but it didn’t really seem to mesh with Jack Darter’s slow monologue at the beginning, so I quickly worked out a more melancholy, slow jazz riff, which ended up becoming the saxophone solo near the beginning of the film, and is used throughout as Jack Darter’s theme. I ended up writing the bulk of the music in the last couple days, whenever I had downtime waiting for video clips to render out and such.</p>

      <p><strong>How do you feel the new site has progressed up to this point, and what do you see in the future?</strong></p>
      <p>Schlaeps came up with a great initial design for the site, and after that we were lucky to have Chris Boyer (Slothpaladin) help create a great film directory system. We’re also hard at work on the resources section, hopefully all these parts of the site will continue to grow.<br>We have a lot of plans for the future of BiM as far as features and new content we would like to add, but the to-do list is long and these things will take some time.</p>

      <p><strong>Final words for the bright budding brickfilmers out there?</strong></p>
      <p>Start with small projects and work your way up. Don’t be discouraged if people don’t always like your first few films, just take it as a motivation to improve!</p>
