      <h2>The Basics of Behind the Scenes - A Set-Up Article</h2>
      <h3><small>Article by Robert Calvert</small></h3>
      <p>Imagine you're new and don't know how to set-up a brickfilm 'Behind The Scenes'. Well in this article, I'll tell the basics of setting up your brickfilming studio.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>A Webcam</strong>
          <p>Presuming you have a computer, do you have a web cam, or a camera connected to the computer.
              If so, great, if not, it's ok you can still
              take photos with a digital camera, but is harder to do so. Back to webcams, the best brickfilming webcams are the Logitech Pro 9000 and C190. If you have some money, you should invest in these.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>LEGO Bricks and a baseplate(s)</strong>
          <p>You can't a Brickfilm with out Bricks can you? What is also helpful is a baseplate, those studded things. With these you should build a LEGO Set... Wow![/sarcasm].</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lighting</strong>
          <p>Now you need to light your set. using 1 to 3 lamps, you should have solid light, but not too strong though, so it is harsh. Play around with your lamps to see what looks best.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Final things you need to do...</strong>
          <p>Secure your baseplate down with clay or tape.<br>
            Lamps in positions which your comfortable with.<br>
            Computer and Webcam on.<br>
            Set Built.<br>
            Animate!
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Those are the basics of how to set up a usual brickfilm studio. Happy animating!</p>
