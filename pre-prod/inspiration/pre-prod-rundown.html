      <h2>Pre-Production - A Basic Rundown</h2>
      <h3><small>Article by BuilderBrothers</small></h3>
      <p><em>Before you start filming a Brickfilm, there are many things that you must do first.  This is the stage known as “pre-production,” which basically means, “before filming.”</em></p>

      <h4>Scriptwriting</h4>
      <p>The first step in creating a Brickfilm is making a screenplay, or in other words, a script. Now, a script, by definition, is a document that outlines every aural, visual, behavioral, and lingual element required to tell a story (in a movie, play, ect.). Basically, a script tells the director and his cast and crew exactly what is going to go on in each scene or shot. A typical Brickfilm script may include dialogue, emotions, the setting, the props needed, and what the lighting and camera angles are going to be needed. When you are making a script for a Brickfilm though, you don’t necessarily need to include all these things (especially if you are the only one working on it). Your script can be as detailed or as simple as you like.</p>

      <h4>Storyboards</h4>
      <p>The second step in creating a Brickfilm is making a storyboard. A storyboard is, by definition, a panel (or series of panels) of rough sketches outlining the scene sequence and major changes of action or plot in a production to be shot on film or video. In other words, a storyboard is like a comic strip for a film. It normally will consist of many panels, each showing an image that symbolizes a scene. Under each panel is information such as dialogue, sound effects, and scene duration. There may even be multiple images for one scene. Every time the camera changes in fact, there can be another image. They are very helpful in planning out your Brickfilm shot-by-shot. The purpose for a storyboard is to help the crew and cast <span class="bbu">visualize</span> each shot. A storyboard can even take the place of a script in some cases, especially if your Brickfilm is very short.</p>

      <h4>Set design</h4>
      <p>The third step in creating a Brickfilm is set design. Now, you may just think that building a set or prop for a film is just like building any other LEGO model. Wrong! Building props for films is often very different than creating regular LEGO creations. For example, when you are creating a prop for a film, there are several important points that you should take into consideration:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>You don’t have to build giant sets to make a good Brickfilm. In fact, small sets are often better when you are filming. Just remember that you <span class="bbu">only have to build sets for what the camera actually sees!</span> This means that you will probably find yourself building a lot of one or two walled props. This also helps to conserve bricks.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>You may find that you don’t have enough bricks to make a new prop right after you finished a shot with an extra large one. No problem! Just take apart the old prop and make a new one with the pieces. Just make sure to film all the scenes that involve that prop <span class="bbu">before</span> you break it!</p></li>
        <li><p>Make sure that your set is pleasing to the eye. Don’t use harsh colors (such as red) if you can. Harsh colors make it harder for your eyes (and the audience’s eyes) to really enjoy your props. Try using colors such as white, tan, sand-blue, or sand-green. Also, <strong style="color: red">DO NOT MIX COLORS RANDOMLY!</strong> This looks absolutely awful, and only makes your film seem really amateurish.</p></li>
        <li><p>Scale is also very important in a Brickfilm. If you had a big overhead shot of a city, and you wanted to make the camera fly over multiple buildings, yet you did not have many bricks, then simply shrink the props! Miniscale building is great for emphasizing distance and depth of field. Another example is if you wanted to have a shot when a guy is on the top of a building and you see lots of tall buildings rising in the distance. While you could try to blue-screen some in (a technique covered later), most of the time it is wise to instead use miniscale. If you just place some miniscale buildings a few inches behind the minifigure actor and make sure they are out of focus, then you get a very convincing illusion of a large city.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Choosing a Camera</h4>
      <p>The fourth step in creating a Brickfilm is choosing a good camera. Though this may seem like an easy thing to do, it is in fact sometimes quite a difficult task. When looking for a camera, the following tips should normally be taken into consideration:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Make sure the camera has manual focus. Manual focus makes it so that you can make your shots look sharp and high quality. Make sure that your camera does not have settings that say “Fixed Focus” or “Auto Focus.” If your camera <span class="bbu">does</span> use one of these settings, then it will make it so that your camera will almost never be in focus.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Make sure that your camera has a fairly high resolution. This is especially important if you are going to choose a webcam. The <span class="bbu">minimum</span> quality that a Brickfilm should have is 640x480.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Decide how much money you want to spend on a camera. There are a lot of good cameras out there, but most of them are quite expensive. If you don’t have lots of money to spend, then probably the best thing for you to get is a webcam. Though many of them are low quality, quite a few are in fact quite good. The highest rated webcam for Brickfilming use is the Logitech Webcam Pro 9000.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
