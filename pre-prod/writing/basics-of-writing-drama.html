        1. Two Main Types of Drama<br><br>
          a.) Tragedies-Serious plays generally ending in suffering and death.<br>
          b.) Comedies-Lighter acts that tend to be funny.<br><br>

        2. Elements of Play<br><br>
          a.) Plot-The sequence of related events that make up the story;puts characters against one another or against powerful forces.<br>
          b.) Stage Directions-Gives actors and actresses lines on where to go on stage and how to feel.  Also can be known as a Narrator.<br>
          c.) Set-A realistic representation of the play's setting.<br>
          d.) Props-Representations of the play's setting.<br>
          e.) Exposition-Usually begins a drama; explains the action that has already occurred.<br><br>

        3. Order of Events (In a basic drama)<br><br>
          a.) Conflict-Difficulties that the characters must overcome.<br>
          b.) Climax-Comes at the end of an act, the big part the changes everything.<br>
          c.) Resolution-End of drama; the conflict is solved whether it is tragic or a happy ending.<br><br>
        Remember this is a basic guide to drama, for more advanced drama you still need to base it around this core.</p>
