      <!--body -->
      <p>Quality voice acting is a crucial component of most brickfilms. Unfortunately, few of us have the talent to convincingly voice all the characters written into a brickfilm. While some are fortunate enough to be able to recruit local talent for on-site recording sessions, most must rely on the pool of talent found here at Bricks in Motion.<br><br>

Unfortunately, many people find their casting calls lost in the shuffle or skipped over by those they'd like most to recruit. They fall prey to the same common mistakes they've seen made by others and, as a result, their finished film suffers because of it.<br><br>

However, fear not, denizen of BiM. With but a few helpful pointers, your casting calls will be in far better shape.<br><br>

        <strong>1. Put time and thought into your writing.</strong><br><br>

A post full of spelling errors and grammatical nightmares is quite the turnoff to most voice actors. If you can't create a well-made post, why should we believe your film will be any good?<br><br>

It's a good idea to have your script written before you submit your casting call. This allows people to get an idea what the script will look like as well as helping you to pick a line that sums up the character, which I'll touch on later.<br><br>

        <strong>2. Post pictures and descriptions of your characters</strong><br><br>

This isn't necessarily essential, but as a voice actor myself, my performance will often reflect my idealization of the character in my head. If the actor has an image of what the character looks like, it will help them to match their performance to said character, which will result in a more convincing characterization in the final film.<br><br>

Character descriptions seems like the most obvious part of a casting call to me, but there are those who neglect it. You don't need to post a novel per se, but give us a few lines that give the actor a premise with which to base their characterization.<br><br>

        <strong>3. Pick important lines</strong><br><br>

The idea of a test line is to get an idea of how the actor sounds as the character, both in terms of vocal quality and acting ability. If you have a character you'd like to establish as a self-proclaimed "ladies man" and you choose a throwaway line like, "I'm going to get some pretzels," it reveals very little about the character. Remember, the test line doesn't necessarily have to be in the movie, but it should serve this purpose.<br><br>

Believe it or not, that's all you really need to know! Despite the common mistakes made by users, it it doesn't need to be difficult to create an effective casting call.</p>
