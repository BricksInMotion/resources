      <h2>Recording Good Lines</h2>
      <h3><small>Article by Chris Wynn</small></h3>

      <p><em>Quality voice acting is a crucial component of most brickfilms. Make sure you attract the best talent by creating an effective casting call.</em></p>

      <!--body -->
      <p>This will help you record good lines for your films, and won't let others down in auditioning for theirs.<br><br>

First, make sure you have a microphone with good quality. Do NOT use your old camera lying around your house to record. Use real microphones, such as the Logictech USB Microphone, or the Blue Snowball (Which are both available for purchase in the BiM store). Now, if you're low on money, buy a cheaper microphone, or you may even want to use the microphone built-in to some webcams, such as the Logitech Quickcam (or Webcam) Pro 9000.<br><br>

You want to create a script before recording lines, unless it's a simple enough story, where no script is necessary. Though, you might just want to write down the lines, maybe not the full-blown script. You don't want to fumble the lines, and make alot of "umms" and "uhhs".<br><br>

Now, you need to know the characters that you're playing. Build the characters BEFORE you record lines for them. This lets you know what style of voice to record. Imagine what they would sound like if they were real people. You don't want to have an old man have a high, squeaky voice.<br><br>

Do's and Dont's:<br><br>

Do: Make sure you're by yourself, with no other noise. I've seen many brickfilms that you can hear parents or siblings talking in the background.<br><br>

Don't: Keep the microphone too close to your face. It makes it sound staticky, and it makes the audience member jump when they hear it.<br><br>

Do: Play around with the special effects on the software you're using. The free software Audacity has many good effects for creating voice effects, from a chipmunk voice, to a Darth Vader voice. I recommend Audacity, though I'm sure there are many more just as good as it out there.<br><br>

Don't: Say the line once, and think you're done. You should start the recording, and say the line over and over in different ways, then review all of the takes, and see which one that you like the best. Also, when auditioning, send the audio with ALL of the takes, so the recipient can decide which one they like.<br><br>

This hopefully will help you record lines well, and will get you parts in other brickfilmers's films.</p>
